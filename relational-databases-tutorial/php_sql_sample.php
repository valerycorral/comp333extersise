            // The MySQLi extension was introduced with PHP version 5.0.0 and 
            // the MySQL Native Driver was included in PHP version 5.3.0. i 
            // stands for improved in MySQLi and provides various functions to 
            // access the MySQL database and to manipulate the data records 
            // inside the MySQL database. You would require to call the MySQLi 
            // functions in the same way you call any other PHP function.

            // If the connection to the database is successful, you can now 
            // query your database using MySQL, e.g., with
            // $sql_query = "SELECT * FROM student_table WHERE student_id = *;
            // (assuming you have previously set up a student table with 
            // the student_id attribute))
