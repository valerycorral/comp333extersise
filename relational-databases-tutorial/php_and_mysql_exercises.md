## Deploying PHP Scripts

1. Try deploying the following Hello World PHP script
   a) locally (i.e., save the code in a file hello_world.php with the content
   below and load it from your local drive into your browser)
   b) on GitHub Pages (i.e., `git push`; as you are doing for your homework)
   Why does it not working in each of these cases?

```php
  <?php $user = "Patti Smith"; ?>
  <html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
  Hello <?php echo $user; ?>
  </body>
  </html>
```

2. Could we use Heroku <https://www.heroku.com/>? If so, how?
